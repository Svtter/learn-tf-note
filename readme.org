* PROBLEMS

** Tensor Tensor() is not an element of this graph.

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown

I had this problem when doing inference in a different thread than where I loaded my model. Here's how I fixed the problem:

Right after loading or constructing your model, save the TensorFlow graph:

  graph = tf.get_default_graph()

In the other thread (or perhaps in an asynchronous event handler), do:

  global graph
  with graph.as_default():
      (... do inference here ...)

I learned about this from https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/framework.html#get_default_graph
